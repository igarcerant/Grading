Grading

About this project
------------------

Grading is an simple object-oriented API for grading students. It is modelled
after the concept of digest, or evaluating a hash function over multiples
calls. After the multiples grades(), you may get the final grade with the method
`calification()` Check-out the unit tests for examples of use.
